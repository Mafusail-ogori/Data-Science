### Bank customer classification

- This project was made to predict a class of user, depending on some of its data. Trained on large dataset, with vast amount of features.
- The model itself is made based on torch and mlp neural network (mlp classifier in this precise case)

### Model startup

- To start a model on a new data, just put a needed data instead of new_input, and name it the same way.

* start a model using **start** script.
* watch for predictions, that will eventually appear in data folder
* you are all set now

### Model specs

- Model based on **MLP** neural network
- 128 hidden layers
- activation tanh
- optimizer - adam (also can try adamax)
- learning rate 0.0001

### Going through labs

If you want to obtain deeper knowledge on how model was selected, and how data is preprocessed, you can walk through the labs folder.
